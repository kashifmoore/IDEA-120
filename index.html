<h1>THIS CHARACTER IS FUCKING CHEAP</h1>
![akumastreetfighter] (akuma.jpg)
  
<p>n shadows deep, a soul does creep Beneath the mask of deceit does it weep A heart so numb, consumed by greed A cheap facade, where no light can lead

Yet with a flicker in the dark A spark of hope, a distant spark May pierce the veil, may mend the seam And redeem the broken dream <p>

For even in the depths of night There's still a chance to make things right To rise above the darkness deep And into the light, finally, to leap

In the world of give and take A balance must be found Yet some hearts are quick to break When pressures do abound

For those who freely give their all Are often taken for granted Their worth diminished, standing tall Their spirit, empty, ranted

But let not the weight of expectation Dim the light within your soul For true worth lies in liberation From others' harsh control

So stand firm, be true to self And let no pressure bind For in your worth, in your wealth Your freedom, you will find.</p>
