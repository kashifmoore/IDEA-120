Big Data and the collection of information of users on the internet presents a serious problem. The invasion of privacy and the selling of information to 3rd parties is an invasive tactic used to market products.
Many of these new Ai algorithms also include many of the "real world" biases and prejudices of their creators. 
These algorithms are often riddled with issues and help to create sustainability for the upper class. 
Lower class and marginalized people are often at the whims of these prejudices created by nuanced quantifiable data.

The data used for these algorithms do not take any of the humanistic variables that alter results. People are reduced to data and are stripped of any agency. 
Big Data is often collected unbeknownst to their participants and benefit only the companies. These algorithms are pervasive in our society. They affect many different sectors in our society. 
In the modern age they affect housing education, and spending habits.
